Description: tool to remove clutter to make reading on the Web more enjoyable
 Readability is a Firefox/Iceweasel add-on that makes reading web pages simpler
 and more enjoyable. The system strips the superfluous information and shows
 the main content in a single column of easy-to-read text. It is also a
 precious tool for printing the web pages in less.
 .
 To use it just click the R icon on Firefox statusbar. Also by right clicking
 on R icon you can get other Styling Options.
 .
 Users can also add a Toolbar button to the navigation toolbox. Just right
 click on any toolbar button and choose the "Customise" option to drag the
 icon in toolbox.
 .
 The keyboard shortcut to activate Readability is CTRL+ALT+R combination. To
 return to original page use CTRL+R combination.
 .
 Readability contains Autoscroll functionality, too.
 .
 As the name suggests Autoscroll functionality will let you scroll the pages
 automatically without using your mouse or keyboard. After you activate the
 Readability and simplify the page, just press CTRL + SHIFT + A keyboard
 combination to start using the Autoscroll.
 .
 Autoscroll does not require activating Readability. It simply works on any
 long web page you come up with. But combined with Readability it just
 improves the idea.
